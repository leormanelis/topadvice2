# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# Advice.create(full_name: "Bob", message: "Bob-Life is short so, appriciate.")
# Advice.create(full_name: "Josh", message: "Josh-Don't spill coffee on your computer.")
# Advice.create(full_name: "Daniel", message: "Daniel-Don't be a code cowboy and test your work!")
# Advice.create(full_name: "Luke", message: "Luke-Who needs testing? Be a code cowboy!")
# Advice.create(full_name: "Leor", message: "Leor-Never leave home without a snack.")
# Advice.create(full_name: "Seth", message: "Seth-It always looks better with flowers.")
